/**
 * Record what PawWork actually puts on the wire to the OpenCode Zen gateway.
 *
 * The identity and session headers this product sends are assembled across
 * three layers it does not own end to end — the pi-ai adapter patch, the
 * product patch, and the fetch preload — and each layer can be read correctly
 * while the bytes leaving the process are still wrong. Reading the sources, or
 * instrumenting the preload, only proves what we intended to send.
 *
 * So this terminates TLS for `opencode.ai` with a throwaway CA and reports the
 * request head verbatim. The app keeps fetching `https://opencode.ai/...`:
 * pointing it at a local recorder instead would make `isOpenCodeZenUrl` answer
 * false, skip the preload, and measure traffic no user ever sends.
 *
 * Every other host is tunnelled untouched, and the CA lives in a temporary
 * directory that goes away with the process.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   pnpm exec tsx scripts/zen-wire-capture.ts
 * then start the app with the environment it prints, exercise the models, and
 * stop the recorder with Ctrl-C for the summary.
