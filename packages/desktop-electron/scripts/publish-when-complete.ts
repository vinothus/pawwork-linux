// Auto-publish the prod release once every target's assets and updater metadata
// have landed in the draft, then dispatch the R2 mirror. Runs at the tail of
// each finalize/full build, so the LAST target to complete flips the draft into
// a published release. Fail-safe: missing targets leave the draft untouched;
// only a complete, single-source release is ever published.
//
// Why a dedicated script (not the by-tag verifier): a draft release is NOT
// reachable via GET /releases/tags/{tag} (it 404s), so we look it up through the
// list endpoint; and its assets must be downloaded via the asset API URL with an
// `application/octet-stream` Accept header, not browser_download_url.
//
// SINGLE-SOURCE GUARD. The assets for one version are assembled across several
// independent, sometimes concurrent build runs (mac arm64/x64 finalize + win
// full), each with its own source commit. Installers carry only the version in
// their names, so the verifier alone cannot tell whether mac and win came from
// the same commit. Three layers, designed to fail closed:
//
//   1. Per-target marker. Each target uploads a distinct asset
//      `pawwork-<os>-<arch>-<version>.commit` holding {commit, sha512} — its
//      build commit and the content hash of the installer it produced. Distinct
//      cells per target (never a shared mutable field), so there is no claim
//      race: concurrent targets from different commits leave disagreeing markers
//      and no run ever sees "all agree".
//   2. Content anchor. Before publishing, every marker's recorded sha512 must
//      still be present in the current latest*.yml. A target rebuilt from another
//      commit produces a different installer hash, so a stale marker no longer
//      matches the metadata — catching a clobber that landed before this run read
//      the markers.
//   3. Seal + re-read. Right before the publish PATCH (the only draft->published
//      write), snapshot the installer asset URLs, settle briefly, re-read, and
//      refuse if any asset URL changed (electron-builder's overwrite DELETEs then
//      re-creates an asset, so a clobber always yields a new URL). The PATCH is
//      the last write — catching a clobber that lands during the publish window.
//
// Post-publish writes happen at a different site (the build's earlier publish +
// finalize steps), so they are fenced there, not here: electron-builder leaves an
// already-published release untouched (releaseType defaults to draft, so its
// publisher skips a published release), and finalize-latest-yml refuses to upload
// to a non-draft release. Together a later same-version build from a different
// commit cannot rewrite the published installers or their updater metadata; it
// fails loudly instead.
//
// Residual: GitHub offers no atomic compare-and-swap across release assets, so
// the finalize guard's draft-check and its upload, and this seal's re-read and
// PATCH, are each two statements. A mixed-source publish would require a write to
// land in the single HTTP round-trip between a check and its write, from a
// different commit, in two builds of the same version dispatched concurrently —
// not reachable by the normal one-dispatch pipeline (each version is built once,
// from one commit). Eliminating even that would need the commit in the asset
// filenames (breaks the updater, the R2 mirror, and the website links) or a
// single orchestrated workflow.
